# pr-check-action

ðŸš¨: This is a **public repository** - donâ€™t ever put private stuff in here

An action to validate that PR's contain a link to a change request. Originally duplicated from [delivered/trello-github-action](https://github.com/delivered/trello-github-action).

# Usage

Add a new workflow in your repo that runs this action. Here's an example:

```yml
name: Require PR links to change request

# Controls when the action will run.
on:
  # Triggers the workflow on pull request events but only for the main branch
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  # This workflow contains a single job called "check-pr"
  check-pr:
    # The type of runner that the job will run on
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # You may want to ignore some users like dependabot
    if: github.actor != 'dependabot[bot]'

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
    steps:
      - name: Confirm link to change request included in PR
        uses: aminohealth/pr-check-action@master
```
